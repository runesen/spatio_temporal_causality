To check a checkbox, replace [ ] by [x], as follows: 

- [x] This is a checked checkbox 

Note that current versions of RStudio for Mac (this will change with RStudio versions 1.3 and higher) will not create a formatted checkbox but will leave the original characters, i.e., literally "[ ]" or "[x]". It's fine to submit a PDF in this form.
 
2. For text answers, simply type the relevant text in the areas indicated. A blank line starts a new paragraph. 
 
3. Comments (like these instructions) provide additional instructions throughout the form. There is no need to remove them; they will not appear in the compiled document. 

4. If you are comfortable with Markdown syntax, you may choose to include any Markdown-compliant formatting in the form. For example, you may wish to include R code chunks and compile this document in R Markdown.

# Part 1: Data

- [ ] This paper does not involve analysis of external data (i.e., no data are used or the only data are generated by the authors via simulation in their code).

<!--
If box above is checked and if no simulated/synthetic data files are provided by the authors, please skip directly to the Code section. Otherwise, continue.

- [x] I certify that the author(s) of the manuscript have legitimate access to and permission to use the data used in this manuscript.

<!-- If data are simulated using random number generation, please be sure to set the random number seed in the code you provide -->

## Abstract

<!--
Provide a short (< 100 words), high-level description of the data
-->

The data consist of four data sets, all of which are publicly available: 

1. Forest loss (remote sensing based spatio-temporal data set)
2. Conflict events (georeferenced spatio-temporal data set, based on reports from newspapers and NGOs)
3. Distance to road (Euclidean distance to the closest road calculated based on a vector-based road-dataset)
4. Population density (gloal population density dataset, temporally explicit at a 5-year resolution)

From the above primary data sets, we generate a single summary data set
on which most of our analysis is based. It can be found in the supplementary
materials under the filename data_xy_colombia_20200616.txt.

### Non-publicly available data

<!--
The Journal of the American Statistical Association requires authors to make data accompanying their papers available to the scientific community except in cases where: 1) public sharing of data would be impossible, 2) suitable synthetic data are provided which allow the main analyses to be replicated (recognizing that results may differ from the "real" data analyses), and 3) the scientific value of the results and methods outweigh the lack of reproducibility.

Please discuss the lack of publicly available data. For example:
-	why data sharing is not possible,
-	what synthetic data are provided, and 
-	why the value of the paper's scientific contribution outweighs the lack of reproducibility.

#### Summary data set

We first describe how to generate the summary data set data_xy_colombia_20200616.txt.
from the publicly avaible data sets mentioned above. 

1. Run 00_Download_ForestLossData.py, which downloads the forest loss data from 
https://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest/download_v1.6.html
and saves it to the files Forest2000.vrt, Gain.vrt, and LossYear.vrt.
2. Run script 01_ForestLoss_Summaries.py, which summarizes the data to 10x10km grid cells and saves it to
Hansen_Summaries_ALL_20190821.csv. 
3. Download the conflict data from 
https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/index.html#ged_global
(choose ”UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED) Global version 19.1” in SHX format)
save it to a file anmed ged181.shp. 
4. Run 02_Conflict-Summaries.py, which then summarizes the data to 10x10km grid cells and saves it to
PRIO-summaries_bestEstimate_20191217.
5. Download the road data for Colombia from http://biogeo.ucdavis.edu/data/diva/rds/COL_rds.zip
6. Run Script 03_CalculateDistanceToRoad.py, which calculates the Euclidean distance to roads at 1km spatial resolution and stores the data to DistanceToRoad_1km.tif (caution: modify the workFolder in the script header)
7. Run Script 04_RoadDist_Summaries.py, which aggregates DistanceToRoad_1km.tif to 10x10km grid cells, and saves it to RoadDist_Summaries.csv
8. Download the population density data, for each of the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 from
https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-population-density-rev11/data-download
(choose Temporal: Single Year, FileFormat: Geo Tiff, Resolution: 30 seconds (approx. 1km))
and save it to files named
gpw_v4_population_density_rev10_2000_30_sec.tif
gpw_v4_population_density_rev10_2005_30_sec.tif
gpw_v4_population_density_rev10_2010_30_sec.tif
gpw_v4_population_density_rev10_2015_30_sec.tif
9. Run	05_Population-Summaries.py, which summarizes the data to 10x10km grid cells and saves it to
GPWv4_summary_20190129.csv
10. Run merge_data.R, which takes as input the following five data sets and generates the summary data set data_xy_colombia_20200616.txt.
    + Hansen_Summaries_ALL_20190821.csv
    + PRIO-summaries_bestEstimate_20191217
    + RoadDist_Summaries.csv
    + GPWv4_summary_20190129.csv
    + uniqueID_country_Biome_LS_Anthrome_20190130.csv
